simple to do for the project to be considered complete

MUST DO

- complete game loop js, mainly requires building functions as listed in the game loop

- finish game highscore screen

- additional styling of buttons and elements in the game
  - highscore screen
  - question buttons to give clarity on what's selected
  - game screen

NOT NEEDED BUT NICE TO HAVE

- change title and title font -> want it to reflect the dark glossy app theme

- implement tester feedback
  - make game not be 100% of screen on desktop
  - cleaner interaction

Current issues

21:06 wednesday - having issues with api data loading after our code is needed -> maybe call function to get / format questions inside api call functions?
